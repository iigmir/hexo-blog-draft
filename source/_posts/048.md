# nginx worker_connections are not enough

I set my nginx for my Mac for developing. However, it goes [500](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/500).

I read access log, gosh, about ten thousand access log there. <br />
Then, I read error log, it said:

<pre>
2018/05/05 15:05:35 [alert] 1346#0: 20000 worker_connections are not enough
2018/05/05 15:05:35 [error] 1346#0: *86966 kevent() reported about an closed connection (54: Connection reset by peer) while reading response header from upstream, client: 127.0.0.1, server: localhost, request: "GET /phpinfo.php HTTP/1.0", upstream: "http://127.0.0.1:80/phpinfo.php", host: "127.0.0.1", referrer: "http://127.0.0.1/"
</pre>

Okay, then, why? I read [Stack overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28265717/worker-connections-are-not-enough) and [netingcn](http://www.netingcn.com/nginx-proxy-error-500.html), found that 500 error may because nginx stuck in infinity loop.

I found my nginx.conf, there are two `location ~ \.php$` nginx.conf. One is:

<pre>
location ~ \.php$ {
    proxy_pass   http://127.0.0.1;
}
</pre>

Looks like it self-reference? So I comment this. Now there's no `nginx worker_connections are not enough` more.
