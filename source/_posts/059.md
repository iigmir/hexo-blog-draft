# Not in mood

I ain't feel good these days. Mostly because I ain't satisfied my personal skill. Also, there're many problems for me.

Alas, maybe I should say something happy.

1. I like [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/), it looks like Vue's single component file.
2. When I read new TocasUI's new naming proposal, I read [rscss](https://rscss.io) and I LOVE IT! That's what I looking for!

I always find that I just don't like most of current popular conventions.

Then I read [Vue3.0's RFC](https://medium.com/@Mike_Cheng1208/vue3-0%E6%94%B9%E7%89%88%E5%9C%A8%E5%89%8D-%E6%88%91%E8%A9%B2%E7%9F%A5%E9%81%93%E4%BA%9B%E4%BB%80%E9%BA%BC-e59ccdcc370d)...I mean I don't like React, but when Vue looks like React......

Finally, if you write tests for Vuex, **write `namespaced` for mock vuex modules**!
