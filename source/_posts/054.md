# Group and sort for SVG elements

I recently develop SVG and encounter a problem: I need to let my text above my shape. Because there are many texts on page, I cannot simply use `z-index` CSS property. When finding how to sort elements, I found [a pen on codepen](https://codepen.io/aeternia/pen/qazrgQ).

It uses [g element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Element/g), which offer elements an container to contain elements, and sort their priority.

I was cried when found that worked.
