# Androidx86 cannot startup

## Trouble

I install [Android x86](https://www.android-x86.org) on my [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org). Installation is okay, but I cannot open it.

I find so many questions, but none of them helps until find out [this answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/56116178/7162445), so I try to switch my graphics controller to VBoxSVGA.

And it *just* works! Jack, this is amazing!

And I still don't get it, don't know why it works? Maybe someday I can find out the answer.
