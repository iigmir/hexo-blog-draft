# As an interviewer

I recently interviewed a front end dev. I ask him the following questions. Of course in Mandarin Chinese:

1. Have you used Vue.js before?
2. What AJAX library you use? `axios`? `jQuery`?
3. Do you know how to get JSON data, then render it to the web page?
4. Do you know how to add custom headers like `Authorization`?
5. What would you do if you find something on the web page disappears?
    * What if you got `CORS Request Blocked`?
6. What would you do if you find the AJAX request fails?
7. I recently use `axios` to send a POST request but find that no parameters have been sent in the request. What do you think?
    * My `Content-Type` is `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` and I am sure that my parameters are correct.
    * [Here's the hint](https://github.com/axios/axios#using-applicationx-www-form-urlencoded-format).

I expect this guy know the following issues by these questions:

1. AJAX call
2. HTTP requests
3. How to know where the problem exists
4. `CORS` issue, `Content-Type` in `axios` issue
5. How to find help

An issue I really concern but haven't ask is about comments and documents writing: I don't know how to ask such questions. Maybe I can teach him when he truly becomes my office mate.
