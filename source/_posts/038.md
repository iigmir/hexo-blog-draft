# 2018/02/08 interview

Honestly, it was an awful interview.

-----

I wrote an survey, some question like:

* "If you have an mission that no one can help you, all you can do is Google, would you accept this challenge?"
* "If you have to overtime without pay, would you accept?"
* "What's your point of view about overtime?"

Well, I got your hint: You must overtime, without any overtime pay. <br /> No money, right?

-----

My view about overtime is that overtime can help you temporarily. However, if you always overtime, you need to think what's wrong because there's problem about your time management.

-----

I didn't asked any technological question because interviewer refused to answer.

And, you said that your company will try me five weeks, with, out, any, wages?
